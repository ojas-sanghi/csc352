<h1 id="programming-assignment-4-columns">Programming Assignment 4:
Columns</h1>
<p>Version 1.0 (2024-02-24) - Initial version</p>
<h2 id="due-date">Due Date:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Friday, 2024-03-01, 3:00PM Arizona Time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download-and-extract-the-assignments-files-from-d2l">Download
and extract the assignments files from D2L</h2>
<p>Download the file <code>distribution.tar.gz</code> from D2L and save
it in your <code>csc352</code> directory.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The structure of the <code>distribution</code>
directory has changed slightly. There is now an <code>assignments</code>
directory that contains the assignment directories (e.g.,
<code>a5</code>).</p>
<h2 id="create-a-directory-for-this-assignment-called-a5">Create a
directory for this assignment called <code>a5</code></h2>
<h2 id="write-c-programs">Write C Program(s):</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will write three different C programs. You
will write each program in a separate file. You will turn in all
files.</p>
<p>All programs will read input from standard input (stdin) and write
output to standard output (stdout).</p>
<p>The programs should only use only the following library routines:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getchar()</code></li>
<li><code>putchar()</code></li>
<li><code>fgets()</code></li>
<li><code>printf()</code></li>
<li><code>strlen()</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not use any other library functions.</strong></p>
<h3 id="right_justified.c">right_justified.c</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads characters from <code>stdin</code>, breaks
them into “words”, and then prints a single column of words,
right-justified in a column that is the minimum width to accommodate all
the words. The program should print a newline character after each word,
and the words are printed in the order they are read.</p>
<p>For instance, this input:</p>
<pre><code>   12345 123

   abcdefgh
</code></pre>
<p>Would become:</p>
<pre><code>   12345
     123
abcdefgh</code></pre>
<p>Use only spaces to create the right-justified column. Do not use tabs
or any other characters.</p>
<p>Your implementation must include and use a function,
<code>int extract_words(char *words[], char *line)</code> that processes
the string pointed to by <code>line</code> and breaks it into words,
storing the words in the array <code>words</code>. The function should
return the number of words found. The function should not print
anything.</p>
<p><code>extract_words</code> should not use <code>malloc</code> or any
other dynamic memory allocation. It should mutate <code>line</code> to
break it into words by placing zeroes at the end of each word, and
should store pointers to the beginning of each word in the array
<code>words</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>fgets()</code> to read the input.</p>
<h3 id="row_major.c">row_major.c</h3>
<p>Like <code>right_justified.c</code>, but the words are going to be
printed in 4 columns, each right-justified. The words are printed in the
order they are read, and the columns are filled from left to right, and
then top to bottom.</p>
<p>The column widths are the same, and are the minimum width to
accommodate all the words in that column with an additional space
between columns.</p>
<p>So, the following would have column withd of 2:</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 

7 8 9 
10 11</code></pre>
<p>Would become:</p>
<pre><code> 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11</code></pre>
<p>There should be no trailing spaces.</p>
<h3 id="column_major.c">column_major.c</h3>
<p>Just like <code>row_major.c</code>, but the words are printed in 4
columns, each right-justified. The words are printed in the order they
are read, and the columns are filled from top to bottom, and then left
to right.</p>
<p>The column widths are the same, and are the minimum width to
accommodate all the words in that column with an additional space
between columns.</p>
<p>So, the following would have column withd of 2:</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6

7 8 9
10 11</code></pre>
<p>Would become:</p>
<pre><code> 1  4  7 10
 2  5  8 11
 3  6  9</code></pre>
<p>There should be no trailing spaces.</p>
<h3 id="variable_width.c">variable_width.c</h3>
<p>Just like <code>column_major.c</code>, but the column widths are not
the same. The column widths are the minimum width to accommodate all the
words in that column with an additional space between columns.</p>
<p>So, the following would have column widths of 2, 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<pre><code>1  2 13 4 5 6 22 23 7 abc d</code></pre>
<p>Would become:</p>
<pre><code> 1 4 22 abc
 2 5 23   d
13 6  7</code></pre>
<h2 id="shared.h-and-shared.c">shared.h and shared.c</h2>
<p>You may use a shared header file and a shared source file to hold
common code. You may not use any other source files.</p>
<p>You must turn in a <code>shared.c</code> and a <code>shared.h</code>
file. The <code>shared.h</code> file should contain only function
prototypes and type definitions. The <code>shared.c</code> file should
contain the implementations of the functions.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use shared code, then you don’t have to. Just
turn in empty files.</p>
<h2 id="pointers-only">Pointers only!</h2>
<p>You may declare arrays to hold values, but you may not use array
indexing. You must use pointers to access the values in the arrays.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-with-them">Experiment with them</h2>
<p>Compile each program using a command like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">cc</span> <span class="at">-Wall</span> <span class="at">-o</span> right_justified right_justified.c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There must be no warnings or errors. (Notice the addition of the
<code>-Wall</code> flag!)</p>
<p>Then, try it with file redirection, like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./right_justified</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span> ../distribution/a3/tests.right_justified/t100.stdin</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="run-the-test-cases">Run the test cases</h2>
<p>Run the test cases using these commands as appropriate. E.g.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">../distribution/a5/test.sh</span> ./right_justified ../distribution/a3/tests.right_justified</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If they don’t all pass, then you have a problem.</p>
<h2 id="turn-it-in">Turn it in</h2>
<p>Turn in all 4 C programs to Gradescope for Assignment A5.</p>
